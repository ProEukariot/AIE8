        "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",

        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

We analyze more than 80 commercial and\\nnon-commercial implementations that have emerged since 2023, including\\nOpenAI/Deep Research, Gemini/Deep Research, Perplexity/Deep Research, and\\nnumerous open-source alternatives. Through comprehensive examination, we\\npropose a novel hierarchical taxonomy that categorizes systems according to\\nfour fundamental technical dimensions: foundation models and reasoning engines,\\ntool utilization and environmental interaction, task planning and execution\\ncontrol, and knowledge synthesis and output generation. We explore the\\narchitectural patterns, implementation approaches, and domain-specific\\nadaptations that characterize these systems across academic, scientific,\\nbusiness, and educational applications. Our analysis reveals both the\\nsignificant capabilities of current implementations and the technical and\\nethical challenges they present regarding information accuracy, privacy,\\nintellectual property, and accessibility. The survey concludes by identifying\\npromising research directions in advanced reasoning architectures, multimodal\\nintegration, domain specialization, human-AI collaboration, and ecosystem\\nstandardization that will likely shape the future evolution of this\\ntransformative technology. By providing a comprehensive framework for\\nunderstanding Deep Research systems, this survey contributes to both the\\ntheoretical understanding of AI-augmented knowledge work and the practical\\ndevelopment of more capable, responsible, and accessible research technologies.\\nThe paper resources can be viewed at\\nhttps://github.com/scienceaix/deepresearch.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-03-05\\nTitle: A comprehensive survey on point cloud registration\\nAuthors: Xiaoshui Huang, Guofeng Mei, Jian Zhang, Rana Abbas\\nSummary: Registration is a transformation estimation problem between two point clouds,\\nwhich has a unique and critical role in numerous computer vision applications.\\nThe developments of optimization-based methods and deep learning methods have\\nimproved registration robustness and efficiency. Recently, the combinations of\\noptimization-based and deep learning methods have further improved performance.\\nHowever, the connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods\\nare still unclear. Moreover, with the recent development of 3D sensors and 3D\\nreconstruction techniques, a new research direction emerges to align\\ncross-source point clouds. This survey conducts a comprehensive survey,\\nincluding both same-source and cross-source registration methods, and summarize\\nthe connections between optimization-based and deep learning methods, to\\nprovide further research insight. This survey also builds a new benchmark to\\nevaluate the state-of-the-art registration algorithms in solving cross-source\\nchallenges. Besides, this survey summarizes the benchmark data sets and\\ndiscusses point cloud registration applications across various domains.\\nFinally, this survey proposes potential research directions in this rapidly\\ngrowing field.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-07-07\\nTitle: A Survey of Deep Learning in Sports Applications: Perception, Comprehension, and Decision\\nAuthors: Zhonghan Zhao, Wenhao Chai, Shengyu Hao, Wenhao Hu, Guanhong Wang, Shidong Cao, Mingli Song, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Gaoang Wang\\nSummary: Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize sports performance, with\\napplications ranging from perception and comprehension to decision.
